# Sanctioned List

Sanctioned List is a website that allows users to search names or entities easily and quickly based on fuzzy partial searches. Currently, only USA's OFAC list is supported.

## Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. OFAC maintains a listing of these restricted counter parties in a document called the "Specially Designated Nationals List" (SDN) that is retrieved and loaded onto this website at least daily.
